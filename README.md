# Netpractice

## DESCRIPTION

Netpractice is a 42 project where we have to configure small-scale networks. To do so, it is necessary to understand how TCP/IP adressing works, including concepts such as subnet mask and default gateway.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### Run the training interface

To launch the training interface:

1. Download the .tgz file from the project [page](https://projects.intra.42.fr/projects/netpractice).

2. Unzip the file.

3. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

### Export configuration

When the index.html file is open, you will see 2 differents sections :
- Training
- Evaluation

To start the training exercises, user have to choose the __Training__ one. In this section, you have to enter your intranet 
login because moulinette will use it to know your own configuration (see the Submission and Evaluation Part [here]).
To train for the evaluation, please choose the Evaluation part. Here you have to complete 3 random execises (usually 
varying difficulty, e.g., Level 6 to 10) in less than 15 minutes.

### Submission

For each level, a non-functioning diagram appears. At the top of the windows, you will see one or multiple goals to achieve :
Adjust the available configuration so that the network functions properly. There is 2 buttons to use :
- CHECK AGAIN : To verify if your configuration is correct or not.
- GET MY CONFIG : To download your configuration whenever you need to. It will be useful to turn in your assignment.

When you completed a level, a new button appear. Click on this button to get to go the next level.

Before Moving to the __Next Level__, you have to export your configuration so you can put it in your Git repository.

Once all the levels are finished, just push your Git repository to the intranet so moulinette can use it to evaluate you.

## RESSOURCES

### OSI Model

To understand how computer communicate, we use the OSI MODEL. It divide the communication in 7 steps. 
Here is 5 of them : 
- Layer 1 : Cables, WI-FI, Electrical signal.
- Layer 2 : Liaison, it's where MAC address is (unique identity) and SWITCH too.
- Layer 3 : It's where IP address is stock, and the rooter too.
- Layer 4 : Where the TCP protocol live.

### Switch vs Rooter

__SWITCH :__ 
- Role : Connect devices within the same network (like in the room or in the desk).
- Analogy : Connect a computer and a printer together in the same network.
- How it workds : Use MAC address to communicate between every member in the network.

__ROOTER :__
